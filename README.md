## Date:
## Objective:
To build a live character counter using JavaScript that dynamically displays the number of characters entered into a textarea — similar to what you see in Twitter or feedback forms.

## Tasks:

#### 1. Create the HTML Structure:
Add a ```<textarea>``` for user input.

Place a ```<div> or <p>``` below it to show the live character count.

Include a label or heading like “Write your message”.

#### 2. Style with CSS:
Center the layout using margin or flexbox.

Style the textarea with border, padding, and font size.

Style the counter to be bold and place it neatly below the input area.

#### 3. Add JavaScript Functionality:
Use addEventListener("input", ...) on the textarea.

Inside the function, get the length of the value (.value.length).

Update the counter element with this number in real time.

#### 4. Enhancements:
Set a maximum character limit (e.g., 100) and show remaining characters.

Change the text color if the user exceeds the limit.

Add emojis or icons using Unicode for visual feedback.
